# [Abandoned] Code Agent Lab

Following along with the FreeCodeCamp [tutorial](https://youtu.be/YtHdaXuOAks?si=CsRYg7ysYiy2zuv3) on building a coding agent in Python.  
This repo serves as a lab notebook — for experiments, notes, and working code.

## Goal

Understand how coding agents are built and explore ways to extend them.

## Status: Inactive

I started this repo while following the freeCodeCamp tutorial "Guide to Agentic AI – Build a Python Coding Agent with Gemini."
I stopped around 1h 38m 50s, right when the tutor looked at VS Code’s autocomplete, called it "_AI slop_," and told viewers to turn it off.

The tutorial was hard to watch and mostly the tutor doing a pass through his course with a lot of errors and mistakes. I watched more than 60% and this repo has all the code that was written in that time.

I don't particularly know what to do with this repo, perhaps deleting it would have been a better option. I might revisit this topic later with labs or personal explorations.
If you want to explore coding agents, I recommend looking at other resources or building your own from scratch.
If you have suggestions or want to contribute, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
