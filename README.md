# Code Agent Lab

Following along with the FreeCodeCamp [tutorial](https://youtu.be/YtHdaXuOAks?si=CsRYg7ysYiy2zuv3) on building a coding agent in Python.  
This repo serves as a lab notebook â€” for experiments, notes, and working code.

## Goal

Understand how coding agents are built and explore ways to extend them.
